Question: I'm planning a 3-day trip to New York with my wife and 10-year-old son in December. We love Broadway shows and want to see the Christmas decorations. Our budget is around $3000 for activities and dining.

Thought: The user provided location (New York), travel party (couple with child), timeframe (December), interests (Broadway shows, Christmas decorations), and budget ($3000). First, I'll check weather for December in New York to advise on proper clothing.
Action: get_weather
Action Input: New York, 2024-12-15
Observation: Weather for New York on 2024-12-15: Cold, possible snow, 2¬∞C.
Thought: Now I'll search for Broadway shows suitable for families with children.
Action: search_attractions
Action Input: new york, broadway shows family-friendly, medium
Observation: Family-friendly Broadway shows in New York: The Lion King, Aladdin, Wicked
Thought: I'll also look for Christmas decoration viewing opportunities.
Action: search_attractions
Action Input: new york, christmas decorations, free
Observation: Christmas decoration attractions in New York: Rockefeller Center Tree, 5th Avenue Window Displays, Bryant Park Winter Village
Final Answer: For your December NYC trip, pack warm clothes as temperatures will be around 2¬∞C with possible snow! 

Here's a suggested 3-day itinerary within your $3000 budget:

Day 1: Start at Rockefeller Center to see the iconic Christmas tree (free), then explore the stunning 5th Avenue window displays (free). Consider booking tickets for "The Lion King" ($150-250 per person) for the evening.

Day 2: Visit the Bryant Park Winter Village in the morning (free entry, budget $100 for skating and treats), then head to Times Square. In the evening, "Aladdin" would be perfect for your 10-year-old son ($150-200 per person).

Day 3: Morning at the Museum of Natural History ($75 for family), afternoon at Central Park if weather permits (free), and perhaps "Wicked" for your final evening ($150-250 per person).

Would you like me to look into specific show dates or restaurant recommendations near the theaters?
